              <p>Document traceability refers to the ability to track and verify the authenticity and history of documents as they are created, stored, and exchanged. This is a critical aspect of many business processes, as it helps to ensure the integrity and security of sensitive information, reduce the risk of fraud, and improve operational efficiency.</p>
              <h4>Examples</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>A multinational retailer needs to track and verify the origin, quality, and authenticity of the products they purchase from suppliers. With EBSI, the retailer can securely and efficiently exchange information and documents related to each product, such as its origin, quality control certificates, and shipment information. This enables the retailer to build a comprehensive and verifiable history of each product, reducing the risk of fraud and improving the overall transparency and efficiency of their supply chain.</li>
                <li>A large financial institution needs to track and verify the authenticity and history of loan applications and associated documents. With EBSI, the financial institution can securely and efficiently exchange information and documents related to each loan application, such as the applicant's financial information, credit history, and collateral. This enables the financial institution to build a comprehensive and verifiable history of each loan application, reducing the risk of fraud and improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of their loan processing.</li>
              </ul>
