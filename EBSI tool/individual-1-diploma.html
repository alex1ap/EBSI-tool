              <p>Diploma verification refers to the process of verifying the authenticity of educational degrees or certificates. In the context of EBSI, diploma verification can be done through the use of decentralized technologies, such as blockchain, to store and manage educational records in a secure and verifiable way. This enables individuals to have control over their own educational records and share them with others only when necessary, while also reducing the risk of fraud and counterfeiting.</p>
              <h4>Examples</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>When applying for a job, individuals are often required to provide proof of their educational qualifications. With diploma verification on EBSI, job seekers can easily and securely share their educational records with potential employers, without the need for paper-based certificates. This can help to save time and effort compared to traditional methods, while also reducing the risk of fraud and counterfeiting.</li>
                <li>When applying for a student loan, students are often required to provide proof of their educational qualifications. With diploma verification on EBSI, students can easily and securely share their educational records with loan providers, helping to reduce the risk of fraud and counterfeiting, and improving the efficiency of the loan application process. This can also help to ensure that students receive the loans they need to pay for their education, while also improving the overall trust and confidence in student loan applications.</li>
