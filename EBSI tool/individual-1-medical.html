              <p>Electronic Health Records (EHR) are digital versions of a patient's medical history and health information. With EHRs on EBSI, patients can control access to their health information, ensuring that only authorized parties, such as healthcare providers, can access it. This helps to reduce the risk of unauthorized access and sharing of sensitive health information, while also improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of healthcare delivery. Additionally, by using blockchain technology, EHRs on EBSI can ensure that the information is secure, tamper-resistant, and verifiable, helping to improve the overall trust and confidence in electronic health records.</p>
              <h4>Examples</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>A Spanish citizen needs to receive medical treatment in Germany. With EBSI, the Spanish citizen can securely and efficiently exchange information and documents related to their medical history and treatment with the German healthcare provider, reducing the time and effort required for a physical visit to the provider and speeding up the treatment process.</li>
                <li>A French citizen needs to receive a prescription from an Italian doctor for a medical condition. With EBSI, the French citizen can securely and efficiently exchange information and documents related to their medical history and prescription with the Italian doctor, reducing the risk of errors and fraud in the prescription process.</li>
              </ul>
